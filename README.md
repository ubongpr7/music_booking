```

### Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file and define the necessary environment variables:
```

DEBUG=True
DB_NAME=postgress
DB_USER=postgress
DB_PASSWORD=postgress
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET=''
STRIPE_PUP_KEY=''
STRIPE_SEC_KEY=''
```

- **EMAIL_HOST_USER**: Your email address used for sending emails (e.g., registration or password reset).
- **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD**: Your email password or app-specific password for authentication.
- **SECRET_KEY**: The secret key used by Django for cryptographic signing.
- **DEBUG**: Set to `True` for development and `False` for production.
- **DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT**: Database connection settings for PostgreSQL.
- **STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET**: Your Stripe webhook secret to validate incoming Stripe events.
- **STRIPE_PUP_KEY**: Your Stripe public key used for client-side Stripe integration.
- **STRIPE_SEC_KEY**: Your Stripe secret key used for server-side Stripe integration.

### Run the Application using Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```


## üìå API Endpoints
For detailed information on the available API endpoints, refer to the `swagger.json` file located in the root directory. This file contains a complete list of the API endpoints, including request methods, descriptions, and required parameters.

For a full API documentation interface, you can also visit: `http://localhost:7745/swagger/`.

## üìä Database Schema
The database schema has been generated using **Django Graph Models**. To visualize it, run:
```bash
python manage.py graph_models -a -o schema.png
```
A preview of the database relationships is available in the root directory as `schema.png`.


## üìÆ Postman Collection
The API endpoints can be tested using the **Postman collection** provided.
1. Import the `swagger.json` file into Postman.
2. Set the base URL to `http://localhost:7745/`.

## üîê Security Measures
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication system.
- **CORS Policies**: Restricts unauthorized access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Stripe Integration & Webhook Setup
1. **Stripe Checkout**: The API supports Stripe Checkout for handling ticket payments. When a booking is created, you can generate a Stripe Checkout session to process the payment.
   
2. **Webhook**: 
   - To listen for payment status updates, you need to configure your Stripe Webhook. Ensure that you have added your webhook secret to your environment variables (`STRIPE_ENDPOINT_SECRET`).
   - Use the Stripe API to validate webhook events that are sent to your server, so you can take action based on payment success or failure.

3. **Integrating Other Payment Methods**: If you'd like to integrate additional payment methods, you can extend the payment processing logic to support other gateways alongside Stripe.
